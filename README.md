# Predicting-social-network-link
In this project, an text file is provided that contains user ids and existing links to other user ids on a social networking platform. Using this, I have done the following:
1. Created a data frame that stores the existing links
2. Calculate the social networking metrices:
  a. Adar-Adamic Index
  b. Resource Allocator
  c. Jaccard Index
  d. Personal attachment
3. Determined all possible links that can exist for a particular user
4. Calculated the above social networking metrices for all the possible links
5. Built a simple logistic regression to predict possible connection propensity
